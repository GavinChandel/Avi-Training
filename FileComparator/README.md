Two separate classes have been created namely - TXTComparator and CSVcomparator.
The Main class is being used to instantiate the desired classes based upon the inputs provided by the user.
In case of a txt file, the TXTComparator class' check() method is being invoked.
And, similarily, in case of a csv file, the CSVComparator class' Check() method is being invoked.
A new txt or csv file will be create based on the nature of the input files provided by the end user.
