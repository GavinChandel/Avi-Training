Updated the 'pom.xml' file with the addition of some new dependencies.
Imported a custom dataset(JSON format) named as 'student-data.json'.
Created a main class and implemented the business logic of reading and parsing the JSON file and finally wrote the final results to a new JSON file named as 'result.json'.
